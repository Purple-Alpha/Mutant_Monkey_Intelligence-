AUTHORITY NOTE (2026-06-16): The routing block above is derived by scripts/mmi_dispatch.py
  and must remain as emitted. MODE: BUILD means the scoreboard has a visible SIGNED_UNBUILT
  next item (#103 first); it does NOT mean Matt has authorized Cursor to begin implementation.
  Matt must still explicitly name the build target. Rows #103/#104 state lifecycle tracking is
  not build authorization. `BUILD_AUTHORIZATION_IMPLIED` in the routing block is mechanical
  sequencer language, not operator build authorization. Current source-of-truth authority for
  component/gate status is mmi/MMI_GATE_REGISTRY.md and mmi/MMI_DECISION_LOG.md; consistency
  is verified by `python3 scripts/mmi_dispatch.py --verify`. Prose below is human context;
  anything marked SUPERSEDED is historical only and is NOT routing authority.

LAST_COMPLETED: Research intake classification index placed

## Active Project Identity Guard

Active project identity: **Mutant Monkey Security**.

Central project brain: **Mutant Monkey Intelligence (MMI)**.

Legacy filesystem path: `/home/socialarchitect/northstar`.

The word `northstar` may appear as a legacy folder path, commit history, or historical reference only. It must not be used as the current active project identity.

Separate app repo surfaces such as `/home/socialarchitect/projects/Architectapp_clean` or `/mnt/c/Architectapp_clean` are not the governed MMI / swarm runtime authority surface.

For governed MMI / swarm runtime work, use:

- Project: Mutant Monkey Security
- Brain: Mutant Monkey Intelligence / MMI
- Authority repo path: `/home/socialarchitect/northstar`

#48 Verification Outcome Agent belongs only in:

`/home/socialarchitect/northstar/core/orchestrator/verification_outcome_agent.py`

Do not build governed MMI / swarm runtime artifacts in Architectapp.
