MODE: ALL_CLEAR
AUTHORIZED_TASK: No evidence-backed next task surfaced from repo state
OPERATOR_NAMES_TARGET: Matt

NEXT_PROMPT_GOES_TO: Matt
REQUIRED_UPDATE_AFTER_COMPLETION: MMI first after any worker completion: append evidence to the relevant MMI record (intake/gate/decision log as applicable), update MMI_CURRENT_STATE.md LAST_COMPLETED prose, run python3 scripts/mmi_dispatch.py --sync, commit routing-authority files, then python3 scripts/mmi_dispatch.py --verify
OPERATOR_ACTION_REQUIRED: YES — no delegable task from current evidence
CANDIDATES_NOT_AUTHORIZATION: YES — queue empty; Matt supplies next evidence
CANDIDATES: (none — external lanes complete, no scoreboard BUILD/AUDIT queue)
NEXT_GATE: new signed contract, scoreboard row, or intake evidence

AUTHORITY NOTE (2026-06-16): The routing block above is derived by scripts/mmi_dispatch.py
  and must remain as emitted. MODE: BUILD means the scoreboard has a visible SIGNED_UNBUILT
  next item (#103 first); it does NOT mean Matt has authorized Cursor to begin implementation.
  Matt must still explicitly name the build target. Rows #103/#104 state lifecycle tracking is
  not build authorization. `BUILD_AUTHORIZATION_IMPLIED` in the routing block is mechanical
  sequencer language, not operator build authorization. Current source-of-truth authority for
  component/gate status is mmi/MMI_GATE_REGISTRY.md and mmi/MMI_DECISION_LOG.md; consistency
  is verified by `python3 scripts/mmi_dispatch.py --verify`. Prose below is human context;
  anything marked SUPERSEDED is historical only and is NOT routing authority.

LAST_COMPLETED: Threat Intelligence Daemon external lane — verified against
  §11-signed `Threat_Intelligence_Daemon_Design_Contract.md` at
  `/home/socialarchitect/mutant_monkey_intel/`; layout + tiering + notification +
  Northstar write guard present; `test_monkey_intel_daemon.py` 11 passed (offline
  TI-INV suite); registry `mmi/EXTERNAL_LANE_STATUS.md` marked COMPLETE; lab record
  `lab_records/2026-06-18_threat_intelligence_daemon_external_lane.md`. Prior:
  parked draft intake INTAKE-2026-06-18-004.
